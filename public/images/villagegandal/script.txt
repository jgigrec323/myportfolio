VillageGandal, organized by PEPCI224, was a standout event with a unique twist. Serving as the event's official website, it provided students with a seamless registration process and a personalized digital card complete with a QR code. This innovative approach aimed to streamline entry procedures, ensuring a hassle-free experience on the day of the event.

Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I developed a fun and dynamic website that incorporated APIs for QR code generation. Backed by a robust database, the admin had full visibility of registered users and could effortlessly validate attendees online with a simple click or QR code scan. With over 200 students participating, VillageGandal proved to be both practical and memorableâ€”an event to remember.
